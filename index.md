My name is Hidenari Nozaki. I'm a software engineer.

I design services and develop prototypes.

Programming languages that I like: Ruby and JavaScript.  
And, I have experiences in variety of languages through my studies at college and works: c, c++, java, objective-c, perl, tcl, python, lisp, prolog, assembly, pascal, smalltalk,...  
Of course, I know HTML and CSS too.

Things that I use for work these days: Ruby on Rails and Node.js

Little bits of personal stuff:
* currently living in Japan working for Orange Labs
* spent 7.5 years in the U.S. when I was a student: started with learning English, spent quite a few years in community college, at last graduated from Cal Berkeley with Computer Scienece degree.
* married with two kids
